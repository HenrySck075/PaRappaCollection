[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/junimeek/parappacollection/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/junimeek/parappacollection)

It's PaRappa. But in Unity!

There's not much else to it honestly

Any help we can get would be greately appreciated, as we're just a small team doing this in our free time!\
If you'd like to help, please friend and DM me on Discord ( Junimeek#5738 ), because right now no-one on the team knows how to code in C# lmao
